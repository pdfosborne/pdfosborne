Expert in applying language agents to reinforcement learning problems.<br>Spend more time swapping Linux distros than I should, mechanical keyboard enthusiast and I enjoy modding old consoles. 

## Projects

### elsciRL
[Website](https://elsci.org/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL) | [Wiki](https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL-Wiki) 

- A novel framework that enables non-technical experts to give language instructions to AI agents.
- Designed from the academic evaluation completed in my doctoral thesis (previously named HELIOS).
- Framework is patent pending with the US Patent and Trademark Office (18/955718), software published under Apache 2.0 license.

Check out the [elsciRL Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbPtl7Sk49Y).


### elsciRL Applications

- [GridWorld Classroom](https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL-App-Classroom): A small educational example that creates a mock classroom of students in a grid layout with the objective to help the Teacher recycle paper.
- [Chess](https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL-App-Chess): Play Chess using Python's default library, limited to first capture to reduce runtime and played against a random opponent with actions filtered by real human player data.
- [Sailing Simulation](https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL-App-Sailing): A simulation of a sailboat moving up a river against the wind trying to avoid obstacles.
- [Gym FrozenLake](https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL-App-GymFrozenLake): A small grid based problem to have the agent move to a fixed goal position whilst avoiding traps, see [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/frozen_lake/) for more info.
- [TextWorld Express](https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL-App-TextWorldExpress): A small collection of text games designed to run quickly, see [TextWorldExpress](https://github.com/cognitiveailab/TextWorldExpress) for more info.

### Firefox Elevenlabs Interface (Experimental)
[Extension Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/elevenlabs-tts-interface/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pdfosborne/firefox-elevenlabs/blob/main/README.md)

- A simple interface for using ElevenLab's API text-to-speech (TTS).
- Reads selected text with a single keybinding.
- Designed for personal use to avoid costly alternatives to improve dyslexia challenges.

### DnD AI Recap
[Example Output Video](https://youtu.be/k8tsXx1lR80) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pdfosborne/dnd-video-recap)

- Uses OpenAI's API to transcribe a DnD session to text
- Each text segment can then be used to create and AI generated image alongisde party based prompts
- Images are composed into a video with original audio matched to the timing

### Eva Plus Theme
[Theme Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PhilipOsborne.eva-plus-theme) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pdfosborne/eva-plus-theme)

- A VS Studio Code theme.
- Customised from a mixture of other themes for personal preference and optimised for Python development.

#### NOTE - I changed accounts in 2023 and kept projects private to protect IP until Nov 2024 where they were repackaged and published, hence the large gap in commits.

You can see my original account [here](https://github.com/osbornep?tab=overview&from=2022-12-01&to=2022-12-31) but projects remain private and so will not show commit history fully.

I am still actively working on re-publishing applications and demonstrations in the updated infrastructure.
