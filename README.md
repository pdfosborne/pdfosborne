## Projects

### elsciRL
[Website](https://elsci.org/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL) | [Wiki](https://github.com/pdfosborne/elsciRL-Wiki) 

- A novel framework that enables non-technical experts to give language instructions to AI agents.
- Designed from the academic evaluation completed in my doctoral thesis (previously named HELIOS).
- Framework is patent pending with the US Patent and Trademark Office (18/955718), software published under Apache 2.0 license.

Check out the [elsciRL Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JbPtl7Sk49Y).

### Firefox Elevenlabs Interface (Experimental)
[Extension Page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/elevenlabs-tts-interface/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pdfosborne/firefox-elevenlabs/blob/main/README.md)

- A simple interface for using ElevenLab's API text-to-speech (TTS).
- Reads selected text with a single keybinding.
- Designed for personal use to avoid costly alternatives to improve dyslexia challenges.

### Eva Plus Theme
[Theme Page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PhilipOsborne.eva-plus-theme) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pdfosborne/eva-plus-theme)

- A VS Studio Code theme.
- Customised from a mixture of other themes for personal preference and optimised for Python development.

#### NOTE - I changed accounts in 2023 and kept projects private to protect IP until Nov 2024 where they were repackaged and published, hence the large gap in commits.

You can see original account [here](https://github.com/osbornep?tab=overview&from=2022-12-01&to=2022-12-31) but projects remain private and so will not show commit history fully.

I am still actively working on re-publishing applications and demonstrations in the updated infrastructure.
